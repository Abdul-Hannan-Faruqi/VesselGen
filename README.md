# VesselGen

This package reconstructs patient-specific vascular networks based on patient priors obtained through MR angiograms. 
It consists of an Image processing pipeline, a Global Optimizer (with fast C-implemented optimization subroutine), and post-processing and 3-D rendering scripts, that work with [Autodesk CAD](https://www.autodesk.in/) packages like *Fusion 360*.
